Game, info and assets for some Game Jam experiments by the game club "Lophtix" https://forening.sverok.se/lophtix

# Game Jam info
LiU Spring Jam 2018 http://liugamejam.se/
Available themes this jam:
* Extreme-dancing King
* Cyote Solitude

# Main idea
Your cyote partner just died of rabies and now you are left alone non-infected with all your rabies-infested puppies that simultaneously want to cuddle and bite you death. You need to find solitude by getting rid of the puppies following you, preferably in a way that does not give you a shower of infested blood or other body fluids...

If you spend time close to a puppy, your annoyance meter increases to potentially leathal levels. If you get far enough away for enough time, then your annoyance level reaches zero (and you'll get a new challenge).
