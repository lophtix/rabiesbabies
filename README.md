# Rabies Babies backstory
Your coyote partner just died of rabies, but you seem to be immune and now you are left alone non-infected with all your rabies-infested puppies that simultaneously want to cuddle and bite you death. You need to find solitude by getting away from the puppies following you...

If you spend time close to a puppy, your annoyance meter increases to potentially leathal levels. If you get far enough away for enough time, then your annoyance level reaches zero (and you'll get some solitude and rest until they find you again).
